# AI Coding
This repository contains my implementation of various ML specific algorithms. I have tried to follow TDD (Test-Driven-Development)   
Inspired by [Vinija Jain's AI Coding repo](https://github.com/vinija/AI-Coding)

The current list includes:
- [Gradient Descent](src/gradient_descent.py)
- [Feature Scaling](src/feature_scaler.py)
